The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that simplifies the construction of complex objects step-by-step. It is particularly useful when creating objects with many optional parameters or when an object needs to be created in multiple steps. 

---

### **Problem Solved by the Builder Pattern**
1. **Complex Object Construction:** When an object requires multiple steps or configurations, managing its creation can become cumbersome.
2. **Code Readability:** Avoids long, complex constructors with numerous parameters.
3. **Flexibility:** Makes it easy to construct variations of the object without needing to create multiple constructors.

### **Real-life Example**
Imagine you are ordering a custom pizza:
- **Problem:** A pizza can have various attributes like size, crust type, sauce type, and a variety of toppings. Managing all these options with multiple constructors or parameters would make the code messy and difficult to maintain.
- **Solution:** Use the Builder pattern to construct the pizza step by step.

### **Code Example: Pizza Builder**

## PHP Code Example

<?php

// Pizza class with options
class Pizza {
    private string $size;
    private string $crust;
    private string $sauce;
    private array $toppings;

    public function __construct(string $size, string $crust, string $sauce, array $toppings = []) {
        $this->size = $size;
        $this->crust = $crust;
        $this->sauce = $sauce;
        $this->toppings = $toppings;
    }

    public function describe(): string {
        $toppingsList = !empty($this->toppings) ? implode(", ", $this->toppings) : "no toppings";
        return "Pizza: {$this->size} size, {$this->crust} crust, {$this->sauce} sauce, with toppings: {$toppingsList}.";
    }
}

// PizzaBuilder for step-by-step construction
class PizzaBuilder {
    private string $size = "medium"; // Default value
    private string $crust = "thin";  // Default value
    private string $sauce = "tomato"; // Default value
    private array $toppings = [];

    public function setSize(string $size): self {
        $this->size = $size;
        return $this; // Enable method chaining
    }

    public function setCrust(string $crust): self {
        $this->crust = $crust;
        return $this;
    }

    public function setSauce(string $sauce): self {
        $this->sauce = $sauce;
        return $this;
    }

    public function addTopping(string $topping): self {
        $this->toppings[] = $topping;
        return $this;
    }

    public function build(): Pizza {
        return new Pizza($this->size, $this->crust, $this->sauce, $this->toppings);
    }
}

// Example usage
$pizzaBuilder = new PizzaBuilder();
$myPizza = $pizzaBuilder
    ->setSize("large")
    ->setCrust("stuffed")
    ->setSauce("barbecue")
    ->addTopping("cheese")
    ->addTopping("pepperoni")
    ->build();

echo $myPizza->describe();


### **Output**
```
Pizza: large size, stuffed crust, barbecue sauce, with toppings: cheese, pepperoni.
```

---

### **Benefits**
- **Readable Code:** You can clearly see the steps for constructing the pizza.
- **Customization:** Easy to customize pizza without creating multiple constructors.
- **Scalability:** Adding new options (like gluten-free crust) becomes straightforward.

### **Real-life Applications of Builder Pattern**
1. **Building UI Components:** Frameworks like Flutter use builder patterns to construct UI elements step by step.
2. **Document Creation:** Tools for generating documents or reports.
3. **Database Query Builders:** SQL query builders (e.g., Knex.js) use this pattern to build complex queries.
